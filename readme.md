### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was my first time using Tailwind CSS. I am now pretty convinced that it's the way to go for styling.

It was also fun to use React's Context API to manage the theme and font state.

### Continued development

- Using a more comphrensive dictionary API (e.g. Oxford Dictionary API)
- Adding more features (e.g. synonyms, antonyms, etc.)
- Making the app full stack, so that users can create an account and save their favorite words
- Adding a search history feature to keep track of the last x words searched
- Adding a favorites feature to save words to a list
- Adding a settings feature to customize the app
